  <p id="first"> I am Duy, a graduating fifth-grader, and I will be starting middle school next year. I was born in Vietnam, and lived there for 10 years. At January, 10, 2020, my family immigrated at America to have a better future there. 
  My hobbies includes soccer, drawing, and traveling. When I grow up, I want to be a succesful person, means that is to have a stale job or career, and have a good family.
